        "There are discrete architectural elements from milestone models that you can use to design your convolutional neural networks. Specifically, models that have achieved state-of-the-art results for tasks like image classification use discrete architecture elements repeated multiple times, such as the VGG block in the [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) models, the inception module in the [GoogLeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842), and the residual module in the [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).

        "\n",
        "This network is **characterized by its simplicity**, using only 3×3 convolutional layers stacked on top of each other in increasing depth. **Reducing the spatial dimensions of volumes is accomplished through the usage of max pooling**. Two fully connected layers, each with 4,096 nodes (and dropout in between), are followed by a softmax classifier.\n",

In particular, we are most interested in configurations A, B, D, and E. Looking at these architectures, you will notice two patterns:\n",

        "2. The second is as the depth of the network increases, the number of filters learned increases as well – to be exact, **the number of filters doubles each time max pooling is applied** to reduce volume size. \n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "However, we know that applying a max-pooling operation will reduce our spatial input volumes. \n",
        "\n",
        "> If we reduce the spatial volumes without increasing the number of filters, our layers become unbalanced and potentially biased, implying that layers earlier in the network may influence our output classification more than layers deeper. \n",
        "\n",
        "To combat this imbalance, we keep in mind the ratio of volume size to the number of filters. If we reduce the input volume size by 50-75%, we double the number of filters in the next set of CONV layers to maintain the balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The issue with training such deep architectures is that Simonyan and Zisserman found training VGG16 and VGG19 to be extremely challenging due to their depth. **If these architectures were randomly initialized and trained from scratch, they would often struggle to learn and gain any initial traction – the networks were too deep for basic random initialization**. Therefore, to train deeper variants of VGG, Simonyan and Zisserman came up with a clever concept called <font color=\"red\">pre-training</font>.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Pre-training is the practice of training smaller versions of your network architecture with fewer weight layers first and then using these converged network weights as the initializations for larger,\n",
        "deeper networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of VGG, the authors first trained configuration A, VGG11. VGG11 was able to converge to the level of reasonably low loss but not state-of-the-art accuracy worthy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The weights from VGG11 were then used as initializations to configuration B, VGG13. The conv3-64 and conv3-128 layers (highlighted in bold in above figure) in VGG13 were randomly initialized while the remainder of the layers were copied over from the pre-trained VGG11 network. Using the initializations, Simonyan and Zisserman were able to train VGG13 successfully–but still not obtain state-of-the-art accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "This pre-training pattern continued to configuration D, which we commonly know as VGG16. This time three new layers were randomly initialized while the other layers were copied over from VGG13. The network was then trained using these **warmed pre-trained up** layers, thereby allowing the randomly initialized layers to converge and learn discriminating patterns. Ultimately, VGG16 was able to perform very well on the ImageNet classification challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "> As a final experiment, Simonyan and Zisserman once again applied pre-training to configuration E, VGG19. This very deep architecture copied the weights from the pre-trained VGG16 architecture and then added another additional three convolutional layers. After training, it was found that VGG19 obtained the highest classification accuracy from their experiments; however, the size of the model (574MB) and the amount of time it took to train and evaluate the network, all for meager gains, made it less appealing to deep learning practitioners.\n",
        "\n",
        "**If pre-training sounds like a painful, tedious process, that is because it is**. Training smaller variations of your network architecture and then using the converged weights as initializations to your deeper versions of the network is a clever trick; however, it requires training and tuning the\n",
        "hyperparameters to N separate networks, where N is your final network architecture along with the number of previous (smaller) networks required to obtain the end model. Performing this process is\n",
        "extremely time-consuming, especially for deeper networks with many fully-connected layers such as VGG.\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"red\">The good news is that we no longer perform pre-training</font> when training very deep Convolutional Neural Networks – instead, we rely on a good initialization function. Instead of pure random weight initializations we now use [Xavier/Glorot](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) or MSRA (also known as He et al. initialization).\n",
        "Through the work of both Mishkin and Mtas in their 2015 paper, [All you need is a good init](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06422) and He et al. in [Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852), we found that we can skip the pre-training phase entirely and jump directly to the deeper variations of the network architectures.\n",

        "Additionally, **we recommend using batch normalization after the activation functions in the network**. \n",
        "\n",

This paper is essential for two reasons. First, the model architecture is tiny compared to AlexNet and VGGNet ( 28MB for the weights themselves). The authors can obtain such a dramatic drop in network architecture size (while still increasing the depth of the overall network) by removing fully connected layers and instead of using global average pooling. Most of the weights in a CNN can be found in the dense FC layers – if these layers can be removed, the memory savings are massive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, the Szegedy et al. paper makes usage of a network in-network or micro-architecture when constructing the overall macro-architecture. Up to this point, we have seen only sequential neural networks where the output of one network feeds directly into the next. We are now going to see micro-architectures, small building blocks used inside the rest of the architecture, where the output from one layer can split into various paths and be rejoined later.\n",

We will be discussing the Inception module (and its variants) later in this section. Once we have examined the Inception module and ensure we know how it works, we will then implement a smaller version of GoogLeNet called \"MiniGoogLeNet\" – we will train this architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset and obtain higher accuracy than in any of our previous section using VGG.\n",

We use these due to the fact that our implementation of GoogLeNet is only able to accept 64x64x3 input images while the original implementation was constructed to accept 224x224x3 images. If we applied 7x7 filters with a 2x2 stride, we would reduce our input dimensions too quickly.\n",

Our implementation is slightly shallower with two fewer Inception modules – in the original Szegedy et al. paper, two more Inception modules were added prior to the average pooling operation.
